# AutoWalk-Duble-tap-W-
Automatic movement in the game with Duble tap W

A Python program for automatic player movement in some games like Snow runner or other games where you need to press the W key all the time and this causes fatigue and damage to your finger

The script works as follows. When you open the program, it is automatically active. Just press the W key twice quickly to hold the key and you no longer need to hold it to move the character in the game. When you want to stop, you can press the W or S key once. The operation stops and returns to normal.

The program is also closed completely with the Control + Q key.

To run, just run the exe file and you don't need to install anything.

To ensure the safety and security of the exe file, I have also included the program code for you.

I hope you enjoy it.
